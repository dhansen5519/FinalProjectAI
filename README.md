# Final Project AI
Final project for CSPB 3202 Intro to AI
Darby Hansen

For this project I considered different RL models to train in a Backgammon environment. The model I chose was a PPO.

To set up the environment:
* Using an Anaconda environment
* conda install pytorch
* conda install -c conda-forge tensorboard
* pip install stable-baselines3
* pip install ale-py
* conda install -c conda-forge gymnasium[atari]
* Use tensorboard --logdir=./ppo_backgammon_tensorboard/ to view visualizations on a local host
